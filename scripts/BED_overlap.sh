# The process was successful in that bedtools generated .bed files that included the overlaps between the two files.
# Once again sanity checking the outputs with the original files is a good way to check the results.
# There were different outputs between bedtools and the unix commands.
# This can be seen in the overlap_counts.txt file, which shows the number of overlaps detected by each method.

# As there are many ways of detecting overlaps, there must be a precise question posed in order to select a method that is most appropriate.
# The instructions given were to vague to determine this. 
# However, bedtools has been developed for the specific purpose of detecting overlaps.
# Therrefore it is likely to be the a more accurate method, than using simple commandline tools.
# The exact arguments to use are dependent on the exact question posed.
